# Tuning MySQL 8 for Large-Scale Database Systems

When tuning MySQL 8, it is essential to consider the relationship between the number of CPU cores, available memory, and various configuration parameters. Properly aligning these parameters with the hardware resources ensures optimal performance, particularly for large-scale systems. Here’s an in-depth guide on how each parameter relates to the number of cores and memory, with specific tuning recommendations.

## 1. General Configuration

### innodb_buffer_pool_size

- **Relationship with Memory:** 60-80% of total available RAM.
- **Consequence:** The buffer pool size directly affects how much data and indexes can be cached in memory, reducing disk I/O. More RAM allows for a larger buffer pool, which is beneficial for read-heavy workloads and large databases.
- **Example:** For a 128 GB RAM server: 96 GB
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_size = 96 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024; -- 96 GB
  ```

### innodb_buffer_pool_instances

- **Relationship with Cores and Memory:** 1 instance per 1 GB of innodb_buffer_pool_size, up to 16 instances.
- **Consequence:** More instances can reduce contention and improve parallel processing. However, too many instances can lead to increased overhead. Number of Cores: More cores benefit from multiple instances as it allows parallel processing.
- **Example:** For a 96 GB buffer pool on a 32-core server: 16
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_instances = 16;
  ```

### innodb_log_file_size

- **Relationship with Memory:** Between 1 GB to 4 GB, total size of logs should be ≤ innodb_buffer_pool_size.
- **Consequence:** Larger log files allow more data to be buffered in memory, reducing disk writes and improving write performance. Memory considerations dictate how large the log files can be without impacting buffer pool efficiency.
- **Example:** For a 96 GB buffer pool: 4 GB
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_log_file_size = 4 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024; -- 4 GB
  ```

### innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit

- **Relationship with Cores:** 1 for ACID compliance, but can be set to 2 or 0 for performance at the cost of durability.
- **Consequence:** Cores can impact how quickly log data is flushed, with more cores providing better concurrency and faster processing.
- **Example:** Not directly dependent on cores or memory.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1;
  ```

### innodb_flush_method

- **Relationship with Memory and Storage:** O_DIRECT if direct I/O is supported by the storage system.
- **Consequence:** Bypasses OS caching, relying more on MySQL's own memory management. More RAM helps accommodate this approach, reducing double buffering.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_flush_method = 'O_DIRECT';
  ```

## 2. Memory and Cache Configuration

### innodb_log_buffer_size

- **Relationship with Memory:** 16 MB to 64 MB, adjusted for transaction size.
- **Consequence:** Larger memory allows a bigger log buffer, beneficial for transactions with significant blob or text fields.
- **Example:** For heavy write operations and enough RAM: 64 MB
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_log_buffer_size = 64 * 1024 * 1024; -- 64 MB
  ```

### query_cache_type and query_cache_size

- **Relationship with Cores and Memory:** 0 (disabled), as query caching can lead to contention in multi-core environments.
- **Consequence:** With sufficient RAM, a small query cache might still be useful for highly repetitive queries but is usually not recommended in MySQL 8 due to internal optimizations.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL query_cache_type = 0;
  SET GLOBAL query_cache_size = 0;
  ```

### table_open_cache

- **Relationship with Cores and Memory:** 2000 to 10000.
- **Consequence:** More RAM and cores allow a larger table cache, which helps in reducing file opening operations, benefiting systems with a high number of tables.
- **Example:** For a system with 128 GB RAM and 32 cores: 5000
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL table_open_cache = 5000;
  ```

### max_connections

- **Relationship with Cores and Memory:** 500 to 2000, based on the number of cores and available RAM.
- **Consequence:** More cores and memory allow handling more simultaneous connections without degrading performance. Ensure max_connections does not exceed the capabilities of your hardware, especially the CPU, which handles concurrent connections.
- **Example:** For a 32-core server: 1000
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL max_connections = 1000;
  ```

## 3. Disk I/O and Logging

### sync_binlog

- **Relationship with Cores:** 1 for durability, or 0 for higher performance.
- **Consequence:** While not directly related to cores, more CPU resources can handle frequent log synchronization more efficiently.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL sync_binlog = 1;
  ```

### innodb_io_capacity and innodb_io_capacity_max

- **Relationship with Cores and Storage:** 200 to 1000 for innodb_io_capacity, and twice that for innodb_io_capacity_max.
- **Consequence:** Depends on the underlying storage system (HDD vs SSD). More cores allow higher concurrency in I/O operations, and faster storage can utilize higher capacities for better throughput.
- **Example:** For SSD-based systems: innodb_io_capacity = 800, innodb_io_capacity_max = 1600
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_io_capacity = 800;
  SET GLOBAL innodb_io_capacity_max = 1600;
  ```

## 4. Transaction and Lock Management

### innodb_lock_wait_timeout

- **Relationship with Cores:** 50 to 100 seconds, depending on application requirements.
- **Consequence:** More cores can handle higher concurrency, but lock waits may still occur if transactions are not managed properly.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 60;
  ```

### max_allowed_packet

- **Relationship with Memory:** 64 MB, adjustable for larger data transfers.
- **Consequence:** Larger packet sizes require more memory allocation for handling big data transfers, especially with BLOB or CLOB fields.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet = 64 * 1024 * 1024; -- 64 MB
  ```

## 5. Performance Schema and Monitoring

### performance_schema

- **Relationship with Cores and Memory:** ON, with specific instruments and consumers enabled based on monitoring needs.
- **Consequence:** Consumes additional CPU and memory resources, so ensure there are enough available cores and RAM.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL performance_schema = ON;
  ```

### innodb_stats_on_metadata

- **Relationship with Cores:** OFF to reduce overhead.
- **Consequence:** Although this parameter isn't directly influenced by cores, more cores can handle metadata updates more efficiently if required.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_stats_on_metadata = OFF;
  ```

## 6. Replication and Backup

### binlog_format

- **Relationship with Cores:** ROW, especially for complex replication scenarios.
- **Consequence:** Multi-core systems can handle row-based replication more effectively, ensuring data consistency across replicas.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL binlog_format = 'ROW';
  ```

### slave_parallel_workers

- **Relationship with Cores:** Dependent on the number of CPU cores.
- **Optimal Value:** Number of cores - 1.
- **Consequence:** More cores allow for parallel execution of replication threads, increasing replication throughput.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL slave_parallel_workers = 31; -- For a 32-core server
  ```

### master_info_repository and relay_log_info_repository

- **Relationship with Durability and Storage:**
- **Optimal Value:** TABLE for both, ensuring durability and crash safety.
- **Consequence:** Using TABLE storage allows crash-safe replication configurations, utilizing available cores and storage more efficiently.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL master_info_repository = 'TABLE';
  SET GLOBAL relay_log_info_repository = 'TABLE';
  ```

## 7. Additional Settings

### innodb_thread_concurrency

- **Relationship with Cores:** Tightly coupled, usually set between 0 (unlimited) to 2 times the number of cores.
- **Consequence:** More cores can handle a higher number of concurrent threads, leading to improved throughput in read and write operations.
- **Command:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_thread_concurrency = 64; -- For a 32-core server
  ```

### tmp_table_size and max_heap_table_size
